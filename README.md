# sf-ntp-ff
 Yet another NewTab extension for Firefox; this time, with the style of Apple's Safari browser on macOS 11+

 I'm still *super* early in this process, so things are a bit clunky at the moment. Beware of bugs! ðŸ‘»
 
## Notes:
- Folders are non-functional (rip), this is the biggest thing i'm working on  
  Right now they will appear as non-clickable buttons on the page. You can currently move and delete them.
- Separators are ignored on the ntp
- There's no release yet, so you'll have to install the extension manually. (See below)
- The background isn't *yet* changable

## Installing:  
Since, again, I'm still working on the extension, there's no releases yet. You can download the master folder above, and then follow the below to text the extension.

From MDN:
> In Firefox: Open the about:debugging page, click the This Firefox option, click the Load Temporary Add-on button, then select any file in your extension's directory.  
> The extension now installs, and remains installed until you restart Firefox.
>   
> Alternatively, you can run the extension from the command line using the web-ext tool.
