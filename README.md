# Modulab (sf-ntp-ff)
 Yet another NewTab extension for Firefox; this time, with the style of Apple's Safari browser on macOS 11+*  
 *With my own flair!  

 One of the main ideas here is to incorporate different elements from various different browser's new tabs.  
 e.g., the 'Chrome bar', which is made to replicate the 'Gmail', 'Images', and waffle menu from Google Chrome's new tab page.

 I'm still *super* early in this process, so things are a bit clunky. Beware of bugs! ðŸ‘»
 
## Notes:
- You can choose from 6 background images included with the site, or disable the image altogether. Custom uploads are coming soon!
- This is very much a beta/pre-release. Expect bugs!

## Installing & Updating:  
As of version 0.3, you can click on the '.xpi' file of the [latest release](https://github.com/futur3sn0w/sf-ntp-ff/releases/latest), which will prompt you to install the extension.  
The process is the same for updating, just click the '.xpi' file and follow the prompts!  

For developers, you can download the [main branch code](https://github.com/Futur3Sn0w/sf-ntp-ff/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), and load it as a temporary extension.  
From MDN:
> In Firefox: Open the about:debugging page, click the This Firefox option, click the Load Temporary Add-on button, then select any file in [your] extension's directory.  
> The extension now installs, and remains installed until you restart Firefox.
>   
> Alternatively, you can run the extension from the command line using the web-ext tool.
