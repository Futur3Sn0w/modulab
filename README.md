# Modulab (prev. sf-ntp-ff)
 Yet another NewTab replacement extension for Firefox; this time, with a modern aesthetic inspired by Apple's Safari browser and Google's Material You.

 One of the main ideas here is to incorporate different elements from various different browser's new tabs.  
 e.g., the 'Chrome bar', which is made to replicate the 'Gmail', 'Images', and waffle menu from Google Chrome's new tab page.   

 This is more of a passion project, so it's far from bug free. That said, it should be plenty usable for daily use. Just beware of bugs! ðŸ‘»

## Installing & Updating:  
As of version 0.3, you can click on the '.xpi' file of the [latest release](https://github.com/futur3sn0w/sf-ntp-ff/releases/latest), which will prompt you to install the extension.  
The process is the same for updating, just click the '.xpi' file and follow the prompts!  
 
## Usage:
- You can upload an image, or select one of 6 **background images** included with the site.  
Modulab will automatically select **theme colors** based on your background, and apply them to the page.
- **Favorites** are populated automatically by whatever items are in Firefox's **bookmarks bar**.  
You can edit, move, remove, or otherwise change any items from either the page or the toolbar, and the respective opposite will update automatically.
- Click the **settings button** at the bottom-right of the page to open the **settings sidebar**.  
From here, you can **enable or disable modules**, and change or disable your background.
- This is very much a beta/pre-release. Expect bugs!

## For developers:  
You can download the [main branch code](https://github.com/Futur3Sn0w/sf-ntp-ff/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), and load it as a temporary extension.  
From MDN:
> In Firefox: Open the about:debugging page, click the This Firefox option, click the Load Temporary Add-on button, then select any file in [your] extension's directory.  
> The extension now installs, and remains installed until you restart Firefox.
>   
> Alternatively, you can run the extension from the command line using the web-ext tool.
